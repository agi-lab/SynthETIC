Description: Creation of an individual claims simulator which generates various 
    features of non-life insurance claims. An initial set of test parameters, 
    designed to mirror the experience of an Auto Liability portfolio, were set 
    up and applied by default to generate a realistic test data set of 
    individual claims (see vignette and paper linked below). The simulated data 
    set then allows practitioners to back-test the validity of various reserving
    models and to prove and/or disprove certain actuarial assumptions made in 
    claims modelling. The distributional assumptions used to generate this data 
    set can be easily modified by users to match their experiences.
