Description: Creation of an individual claims simulator which generates various
    features of non-life insurance claims. An initial set of test parameters,
    designed to mirror the experience of an Auto Liability portfolio, were set
    up and applied by default to generate a realistic test data set of
    individual claims (see vignette). The simulated data set then allows
    practitioners to back-test the validity of various reserving models and to
    prove and/or disprove certain actuarial assumptions made in claims
    modelling. The distributional assumptions used to generate this data set can
    be easily modified by users to match their experiences. Reference: Avanzi B,
    Taylor G, Wang M, Wong B (2020) "SynthETIC: an individual insurance claim
    simulator with feature control" <arXiv:2008.05693>.
